# latest-frontend-web-technology
"We used jQuery before it was cool" This repository is dedicated to the absolute latest and (maybe sometimes) greatest in web technology with a focus on tools that facilitate rapid front end web application development. Frameworks, compilers, you name it, are all game. You won't find back-end software in this repo though.
